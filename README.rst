ghini.tour
====================

Garden audio guide and geographic tour.

idea
--------------------

The ghini.tour app offers visitors something functionally similar to the
audio guides offered at the entrance of most modern musea.

The guide offers a detailed map of the garden on which a visitor can see
their precise position, and spoken text associated to spots in the garden,
and that's about it.

There is only one ghini.tour; each guide is just a ghini.tour configuration:
visitors download a configuration from the ghini.tour configuration menu,
use it during their visit, and may choose to remove it after they leave the
garden.

configuring and installing
-------------------------------

Garden administrators willing to provide a ghini.tour of their garden, need
to:

* Make sure that openstreetmap precisely and accurately describes your
  garden,
* Write an introduction text for your garden,
* Provide a set of points of interest (POIs) for your garden, each with its
  own text description, in as many languages as you think appropriate,
* Apart from the openstreetmap edits, send the data to me, so I can include
  it in our data repository.
* Some financial support would be welcome: hosting your data costs me money.
  
Garden visitors only need to:

* Install the free and ads-free ghini.tour from google play,
* Start ghini.tour,
* Select and download the garden among the available tours,

Although we talk about gardens and botany, the guides you can use with
ghini.tour are not at all limited to botanic gardens.

keeping track of tours
----------------------------

We haven't decided yet, but I wish to

* Have tour texts on weblate, with one configuration marked as the "source"
  and then translations to whatever other languages we desire,
* Let ghini.tour download POIs, texts and audio from ghini.me,
* The server at ghini.me would be producing the audio files automatically,
